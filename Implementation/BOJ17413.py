#The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible.
#  Sometimes this behaviour isnâ€™t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against '<a> b <c>',
#  it will match the entire string, and not just '<a>'. Adding ? after the qualifier makes
#  it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will 
# be matched. Using the RE <.*?> will match only '<a>'.
